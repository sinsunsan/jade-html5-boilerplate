# Jade HTML5 Boilerplate
Forked from https://github.com/dmotz/jade-html5-boilerplate/blob/master/layout.jade

What I want to add is the integration with the extends syntax that allow to extends this layout with other jade template, without having to modify it 

See this post to know what extends is

> Simple port of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) to [Jade](http://jade-lang.com)

All credit goes to the [original contributors](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/graphs/contributors).

Discretionary portions of the original HTML5 Boilerplate are included,
but left as unbuffered comments by default. Uncomment to enable them.

`layout.jade` uses [Express](http://expressjs.com)-based resource paths,
while `layout_vanilla.jade` uses the originals.

Run `./build` to output the templates as HTML files.

Run `./test` to test the template renderings against references.

Tested with Jade 0.34.1.
